> *"I'm doing a (free) operating system, (just a Hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)"* - Linus Torvalds, 1991

An *(unfinished)* operating system I am designing, inspired by Linux and built on Caffeine. Note that I am not exactly the best OS Designer, but I have tried my best to leave comments almost everywhere to explain everything. An OS is something every developer wants to make, but almost everyone lacks the knowledge, courage, or maybe they just don't have the time. Fortunately, I have a lot of free-time, and I am stupid enough to think I can pull off building an OS. The only thing covering my idiocy is the smart people who wrote the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org).

The project, as mentioned earlier, is currently unfinished. Do not be surprised if it's horrible, unusable, and absolute trash. As of this commit, the "Operating system" is a (un)fancy text editor that does absolutely nothing. I am still learning how to write this thing, and (hopefully) it will one day become usable.
